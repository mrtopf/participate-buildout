Petition Tool
=============

The petition tools consists of the following elements:

- a list of user created petitions
- comments for these petitions
- a up/down voting mechanism for petitions
- a up/down voting mechanism for comments

Then we have several configuration parameters:

- Phase definitions:
    - date until new petitions and votable comments can be added. Here petitions itself cannot be voted
    - date range when petitions can be voted but not comments anymore 
    - date when voting end
    - commenting should be enabled always
    - what about testing phase where politics tests and comments on petitions?
- who can edit petitions: only admins, users only can create, user can edit later again (as long as voting phase has not happened)

There could be seperate topics in which you can add petitions. Topics also contain the configuration

- a simple plain configuration screen based on the field types might be nice
